## Boardfarm to Virutalize devices

Boardfarm is designed to virtualize the environment with the help of docker compose.Entire setup could be setup locally enabling usability.

## Scalability and Extensibility

Boardfarm is designed to be scalable and extensible, accomodating multiple devices and complex network topologies. It allows adding new devices thus it isadaptable to different requirements.

## Integration with CI systems

Boardfarm can integrate with CI systems, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD pipelines, allowing for seamless integration of network device testing into the overall software development and delivery processes.

## Device Abstraction

Boardfarm offers device abstraction layers to support various hardware platforms.These abstractions provide a unified interface for interacting with devices, regardless of their underlying technology or manufacturer.
