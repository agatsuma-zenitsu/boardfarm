# What is boardfarm?

Boardfarm is an opensource framework used to boot,configure and bring up end-to-end infrastructure. It also holds generic libraries to create own device classes.
When used with continuous integration servers, such as Jenkins, boardfarm tests new code commits and nightly builds by flashing software.
